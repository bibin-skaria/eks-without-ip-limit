# This layer is for application deployments
# Placeholder for future application resources like:
# - Helm charts
# - Kubernetes manifests  
# - Application-specific resources

# Example structure:
# module "application_a" {
#   source = "../../../modules/applications/app-a"
#   ...
# }

# For now, this layer can be empty or contain basic monitoring/logging applications
